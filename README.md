# picard-scripts

Naming scripts, utility scripts, script functions and snippets for MusicBrainz Picard

## Description

This repository is intended to provide a collection of scripts and script functions (snippets) that can be used with [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).  The collection is separated into three categories:

1. Naming Scripts: Scripts used for file naming.
2. Tagging Scripts: Scripts used to provide variables used for tagging.
3. Script Snippets: Stand-alone functions or snippets that can be used within full tagging or naming scripts.

The scripts and snippets contained in this repository are provided free for use by their authors without any warranty expressed or implied, in the hopes that others may find the information useful.  All scripts and snippets are provided under the GNU Public License (GPLv3), unless another license is specified within the script or snippet.

This repository is intended to augment, rather than replace, the [***Repository for neat file name string patterns and tagger script snippets***](https://community.metabrainz.org/t/repository-for-neat-file-name-string-patterns-and-tagger-script-snippets/2786) thread on the [MetaBrainz Community Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/).  By maintaining it as a git repository, the scripts and snippets can be easily updated and the user is always presented with the most up-to-date version.

## Contributing

Script and snippet authors are encouraged to contribute to this collection.  Please review the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information.
