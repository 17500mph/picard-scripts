When submitting a contribution, please follow the suggested guidelines:

1. Each contribution (i.e.: script or snippet) should be placed in a separate subdirectory under the appropriate submission-type directory.
2. The subdirectory name should be added to the README.md file in the submission-type directory, along with a brief description of the script or snippet submitted.
3. The subdirectory should contain the submitted script or snippet in a plain text file.
4. The subdirectory should contain a README.md file with a more extensive description of the script or snippet, possibly including such information as: title; author; contact information; date; revision; license; requirements (e.g.: plugins required); settings; and usage instructions.
5. Optionally, the subdirectory may contain a separate REVISIONS.md file to capture the revision history of the script or snippet.
6. The script or snippet text file should contain a header enclosed in a `$noop()` statement, which should include: title; author; date; revision; and license.
7. The pull request title should begin with either **[NEW]** or **[UPDATE]**, followed by the title of the script or snippet.
